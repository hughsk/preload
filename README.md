# preload [![experimental](http://hughsk.github.io/stability-badges/dist/experimental.svg)](http://github.com/hughsk/stability-badges) #

Load images, scripts and CSS with XHR progress events where supported.

This has been written more for large, script/asset-heavy pages such as games
or WebGL demos where the page is already going to take 5+ seconds to load.
As such, it's not as small as it could be - I'd recommend
[LazyLoad](https://github.com/rgrove/lazyload) if you're looking for
a lightweight solution.
